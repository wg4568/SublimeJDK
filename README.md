Modifications to default JavaC plugin for Sublime Text 3.

Changes the build system to include:
 - Build and Execute
 - Build Only
 - Execute Only
 - Make JAR

Please make sure `javac`, `jar`, and `java` commands are all added to your PATH.

Note that "Make JAR" uses the currently opened file as the entrypoint for your jar file.
